			<h2>1.The game</h2>
			<p>
			<img src="../../../HTML2/src/htmltags/Images/miclogo.png" alt="" width="20" height="20"><strong>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG)</strong> is a multiplayer online battle royale video game developed and published by Bluehole. The game is based on previous mods that were developed by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games using the 2000 film <em>Battle Royale</em> for inspiration, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's world decreases in size over a match, directing surviving players into tighter areas and forcing encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.

			<h2>2.Gameplay</h2>
			<p>
			 <img src="../../../HTML2/src/htmltags/Images/miclogo.png" alt="" width="20" height="20">Battlegrounds is an action game in which up to one hundred players fight in a battle royale, a type of large-scale last man standing deathmatch where players fight to be the last alive. Players can choose to enter the match solo, or with a small team of up to four people. In either case, the last person or team left alive wins the match.

Each match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto a map area approximately 8 by 8 kilometres (5.0 mi Ã— 5.0 mi) in size,[1] The plane's flight-path across the map varies with each round, requiring players to quickly determine the best time to parachute out.[2] Players start with no gear beyond customized clothing selections which do not affect gameplay. Once they land, players can search buildings and other sites to find weapons, vehicles, armor, clothing, and other equipment. These items are procedurally distributed throughout the map at the start of a match, with certain high-risk zones typically having better equipment.[2] Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear as well.

			<h2>3.Development</h2>
			<p>
			<img src="../../../HTML2/src/htmltags/Images/miclogo.png" alt="" width="20" height="20">Lead designer <strong>Brendan Greene</strong>, better known by his online handle PlayerUnknown, had previously created the ARMA 2 mod DayZ: Battle Royale, an offshoot of popular mod DayZ, and inspired by the 2000 film Battle Royale.[7][8] At the time he created <em>DayZ: Battle Royale</em> around 2013, Irish-born Greene had been living in Brazil for a few years as a photographer, graphic designer, and web designer, and played some video games such as Delta Force: Black Hawk Down and America's Army.[9][10] The DayZ mod caught his interest, both as a realistic military simulation and its open-ended gameplay, and started playing around with a custom server, learning programming as he went along.[9] Greene had been inspired to create the Battle Royale mod as he found that in most multiplayer first-person shooter games, there was too much repetition, as maps were small and easy to memorize. He wanted to create something with more random aspects so that players would not know what to expect, creating a high degree of replayability; this was done by creating vastly larger maps that could not be easily memorized, and using random item placement across it.[11] Greene was also inspired by an online competition for DayZ called Survivor GameZ, which featured a number of
			<em>Twitch.tv</em> and YouTube streamers fighting until only a few were left; as he was not a streamer himself, Greene wanted to create a similar game mode that anyone could play.[11] His initial efforts on this mod were more inspired by <em>The Hunger Games</em> novels, where players would try to vie for stockpiles of weapons at a central location, but moved away from this partially to give players a better chance at survival by spreading weapons around, and also to avoid copyright issues with the novels.[8] In taking inspiration from the Battle Royale film, Greene had wanted to use safe square areas, but his inexperience in coding led him to use circular safe areas instead, which persisted to Battlegrounds.[8]
